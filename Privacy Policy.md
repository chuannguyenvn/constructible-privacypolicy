# Constructible - Privacy Policy

I'm Nguyễn Trọng Chuẩn, the developer of the game. Thank you for checking out my little game!

Constructible will generate data such as high score, total moves made, piece with the most moves, etc. The game does not require any real-life data from you.

Constructible does not automatically upload your data to any cloud storage. The game only stores your data locally, and there is no way to associate you with the local data generated by you. You can easily delete the data by uninstalling the game or by using a file explorer.

By playing the game, you only consent to the local processing of your information.

*If you have any question, feel free to send me an email at parttimemaniac@gmail.com.*
